# An assignment to calculate the number of working bureaus in a study hall

w = float(input())    # Width of hall
h = float(input())    # Height of hall

w_to_cm = w*100       # Width in centimeters
h_to_cm = h*100       # Height in centimeters

rows = w_to_cm//120   # How many rows are there, each taking 120 centimeters

h_to_cm -= 100        # Subtracting 100 from height to account for a corridor


bureaus_in_row = h_to_cm//70
# How many bureaus in every row, each taking 70 centimeters

all_bureaus = rows*bureaus_in_row - 3
# All bureaus minus the space needed for entrance and teacher's podium
